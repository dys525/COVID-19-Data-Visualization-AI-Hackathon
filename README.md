## Description

## Installation

I used Anaconda(Python 3.7.6) with the following libraries installed: geopandas, geoplot, fiona, gdal, pyproj, shapely, etc.) Can be downloaded and installed manually or simply use the following command: conda install <code>-c conda-forge geoplot geopandas shapely</code>

## Contents

Key questions I want to ask, solve and evaluate:

1. Where are the most dangerous regions of Seoul (places that infected people visited

2. Can we conclude that the 20s are the safest group from COVID-19?

3. Are the conditions significantly different between the capital metropolitan area (Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi Province) and the rest(non-capital area)?
