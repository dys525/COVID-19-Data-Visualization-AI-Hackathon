# COVID-19 Data Visualization AI Hackathon

Key questions I want to ask and solve:

1. Where are the most dangerous regions of Seoul (places that infected people visited

2. Can we conclude that the 20s are the safest group from COVID-19?

3. Are the conditions significantly different between the capital area (Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi Province) and the rest(non-capital area)?
